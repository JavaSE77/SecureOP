# SecureOP
This is a plugin or minecraft that prevents users from using the :op command and requires a password to set players as operators.
Passwords are stored using SHA-256 encryption, and through the use of a custom 4J log filter, the password will never be logged in plain text.
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/secure-op.12953/ This is free and open source software! Please use it, otherwise all my hard work will be wasted. Feel free to use and modify the code however you like, that's what it is here for. This version works with spigot 1.16.5+. If you need an older version, you can download one from the spigot page under version history
